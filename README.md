# Nancy-Web-API-Self-Documentation

Warnings, use at your own risk, the code is still at prototyping stage.

I have enjoyed the self generated help pages for endpoint in ASP.NET WebApi.
For whatever reason my new company decided to go with Nancy, which is probably a sound decision if ASP.NET 5 isn't just around the corner.

Anyway, I want the self documention feature in Nancy, and couldn't find any out there.

However with Nancy.AttributeRouting project and source code from ASP.NET HelpPages, 
it was pretty easy to build this feature into Nancy. Unless, I'm miss something, 
I think Nancy team should add this feature.

Currently, the self documenting help pages work for common use cases.
